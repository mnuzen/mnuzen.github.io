<h2>The Traveler</h2>


<p>
“Let me tell you something,” she says
</p>
<p>
Her fingers reach out and
</p>
<p>
Tuck themselves into the spill of my sleeve.
</p>
<p>
Her mouth curls into a smile,
</p>
<p>
Wine-dark and secretive
</p>
<p>
In the near dark.
</p>
<p>
We are on the fresh grass of a dark lawn,
</p>
<p>
Underneath an open sky.
</p>
<p>
Neighborhood lights glint
</p>
<p>
Against her hair.
</p>
<p>
My ankle brushes a bare patch of earth.
</p>
<p>
We are everywhere,
</p>
<p>
All at once.
</p>
<p>
“I can travel,” she says.
</p>
<p>
“Anywhere I want. Whenever I want.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t believe you,” is the first thing I want to say.
</p>
<p>
I don’t say it. I say,
</p>
<p>
“Show me.”
</p>
<p>
She pulls out a pair of
</p>
<p>
White headphones.
</p>
<p>
Plugs in the jack into her phone
</p>
<p>
In the near darkness
</p>
<p>
As though she’s done it a hundred thousand times.
</p>
<p>
Offers one earbud in a way that
</p>
<p>
I can’t refuse.
</p>
<p>
So I take the bud.
</p>
<p>
White light from her screen.
</p>
<p>
Her nails tap.
</p>
<p>
Music starts
</p>
<p>
Through our shared headphones:
</p>
<p>
the soft chords of a piano,
</p>
<p>
Notes strung together delicately,
</p>
<p>
Swaying, like ships at sea.
</p>
<p>
She says, “This is Italy.”
</p>
<p>
She says, “Can you hear the waterways?
</p>
<p>
“Can you hear how pretty it is?
</p>
<p>
“The swaying gondolas, and
</p>
<p>
“The cobblestone streets, and
</p>
<p>
“Stone footbridges and—”
</p>
<p>
And I recognize the song.
</p>
<p>
It’s something by Mendelssohn.
</p>
<p>
I catch a glimpse of the screen:
</p>
<p>
<em>Venetian Gondola Song, Opus 30, Number 6. </em>
</p>
<p>
“I think so,” I say.
</p>
<p>
“Close your eyes,” she says. <br>
I close my eyes.
</p>
<p>
Sunlight hits the water just right,
</p>
<p>
Illuminates every ripple and lights up
</p>
<p>
The row of beautiful gondola boats
</p>
<p>
Swaying by the promenade.
</p>
<p>
An old cafe, on the other side of the street.
</p>
<p>
The smell of hot Italian espresso
</p>
<p>
Lingering in the air.
</p>
<p>
Purple wisteria flowers crawl
</p>
<p>
Over window flower boxes,
</p>
<p>
Spilling out of stone cracks.
</p>
<p>
An oil painting kind of scene
</p>
<p>
Like someone painted in busy bougainvillea
</p>
<p>
With paper-thin strokes of purple,
</p>
<p>
Dragged white across the blue sky in
</p>
<p>
Broad, sweeping strokes
</p>
<p>
To create clouds.
</p>
<p>
Timeless.
</p>
<p>
“I think—” I start to say.
</p>
<p>
I don’t finish.
</p>
<p>
I’m about to open my eyes.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t,” she says. I hear her tap her phone.
</p>
<p>
The song changes.
</p>
<p>
“This is Russia.”
</p>
<p>
She reads to me before I can ask,
</p>
<p>
“Stravinsky’s <em>Firebird</em> suite.”
</p>
<p>
An orchestral piece
</p>
<p>
Cellos calling out dark
</p>
<p>
Deep forests.
</p>
<p>
Violas playing a violet sky.
</p>
<p>
Scarlet feathers of a phoenix
</p>
<p>
Litter the floor like
</p>
<p>
Breadcrumbs in a fairytale.
</p>
<p>
There is something
</p>
<p>
Undeniably magical about it:
</p>
<p>
The smell of petrichor and
</p>
<p>
The leaves crumbling underfoot and
</p>
<p>
The untamed and
</p>
<p>
Untouched wilderness.
</p>
<p>
The song ends.
</p>
<p>
There’s a breath, a pause, before the next one begins.
</p>
<p>
“This is Austria.”
</p>
<p>
A small cottage somewhere in the countryside:
</p>
<p>
A small home with wildflowers in the front
</p>
<p>
And an enormous garden in the back.
</p>
<p>
Sunlight dappling my bare shoulders
</p>
<p>
As I walk
</p>
<p>
Under lemon trees.
</p>
<p>
I smell wild herbs and
</p>
<p>
Fipe tomatoes and
</p>
<p>
Yellow summer. Plump olives and
</p>
<p>
Unruly dandelions and the constant sound of bees—
</p>
<p>
Their smell, their feet
</p>
<p>
Brushed with the spices of a thousand different flowers.
</p>
<p>
Picking blood oranges and
</p>
<p>
Discovering mosquito-breeding ground by the rain barrel next to the shed,
</p>
<p>
Following the buzz of goldfuzzed bees; and
</p>
<p>
Walking, stumbling,
</p>
<p>
Half-drunk on the scent of pollen, the
</p>
<p>
Mellow dandelion wine swirling in the air.
</p>
<p>
Sun-broken fields, the land swallowed in summer.
</p>
<p>
Bare feet on raw earth.
</p>
<p>
The taste of sunlight.
</p>
<p>
The song ends. A pause.
</p>
<p>
“This is Korea,” she says.
</p>
<p>
I don’t recognize this song, but it’s
</p>
<p>
Something more upbeat, k-pop.
</p>
<p>
We spend a while in Seoul, a
</p>
<p>
Fast and glamorous city
</p>
<p>
Full of people young and hungry and chasing something.
</p>
<p>
Fish cakes and roasted sweet potatoes and
</p>
<p>
Lamb skewers and candied peanuts
</p>
<p>
In the night market.
</p>
<p>
Bumper-to-bumper traffic,
</p>
<p>
Red tail-lights burning into a deep red blur.
</p>
<p>
A pause.
</p>
<p>
Guitar, this time.
</p>
<p>
“This is Nicaragua.”
</p>
<p>
A bicycle food cart selling soft drinks and chicharrones.
</p>
<p>
Another selling wedges of mangos,
</p>
<p>
Soft and sweet and ripe and yellow.
</p>
<p>
“This is Canada.”
</p>
<p>
Mountain cliffs growing up and up and up
</p>
<p>
And scraping at an impossibly large sky.
</p>
<p>
This is wildflowers
</p>
<p>
Blooming at twilight,
</p>
<p>
And a hundred thousand diamonds
</p>
<p>
Scattered across the velvet sky.
</p>
<p>
This is open air and
</p>
<p>
Ancient rock and
</p>
<p>
History untouched.
</p>
<p>
This is Venice.
</p>
<p>
This is Carthage.
</p>
<p>
This is Tel Aviv and Daegu and
</p>
<p>
Hanoi and Managua and
</p>
<p>
Everywhere, all at once
</p>
<p>
All of the places you could ever want to go.
</p>
<p>
“Let me tell you something,” she says.
</p>
<p>
She smiles,
</p>
<p>
Wine-dark and far too knowing.
</p>
<p>
We’re sitting on a dark lawn,
</p>
<p>
But we’re everywhere,
</p>
<p>
All at once.
</p>
<p>
“I can travel to anywhere I want. Whenever I want.”
</p>
<p>
I watch as she rolls up
</p>
<p>
The white wires of her headphones,
</p>
<p>
Quick and efficient,
</p>
<p>
As though she’s done so a
</p>
<p>
Hundred thousand times. I say,
</p>
<p>
“I believe you.”
</p>
<h2>If Cassini Were a Person</h2>


<p>
Afterwards, this is the question she asks:
</p>
<p>
“When will we go again?”
</p>
<p>
She’s the kind of person you write about
</p>
<p>
The kind of person you see in a coffee shop and
</p>
<p>
Wish you could take a picture
</p>
<p>
She’s
</p>
<p>
Three black hair ties around her wrist
</p>
<p>
Nails short and efficient but
</p>
<p>
Painted sparkling silver
</p>
<p>
She’s
</p>
<p>
Good with a camera and even better with a pen
</p>
<p>
Quick, dry humor and an infectious laugh
</p>
<p>
At every moment
</p>
<p>
She’s
</p>
<p>
Got a little patch of freckles on her left elbow
</p>
<p>
A constellation that she swears is a map
</p>
<p>
Of the solar system
</p>
<p>
The kind of person who wants to figure out
</p>
<p>
How to bottle up the stars and pour them
</p>
<p>
Into her coffee
</p>
<p>
So she can taste a bit of the universe
</p>
<p>
Every morning
</p>
<p>
The kind of person who’s
</p>
<p>
A starry-eyed tourist in her own town
</p>
<p>
Peering at everything through fresh eyes
</p>
<p>
Her lipstick is peach pink and she wears
</p>
<p>
Those little gold earrings in the shapes of
</p>
<p>
Planets and stars and comets
</p>
<p>
She loves her mother
</p>
<p>
She loves her planet
</p>
<p>
She wonders where we are from
</p>
<p>
She takes you on an adventure
</p>
<p>
Asks, spontaneously, for a day out
</p>
<p>
A road trip
</p>
<p>
She’s
</p>
<p>
Driving, pushing 90 on the freeway with the windows down
</p>
<p>
The music turned up
</p>
<p>
A handheld camera shakily recording
</p>
<p>
Every moment
</p>
<p>
She’s
</p>
<p>
Jumping barefoot into river water and
</p>
<p>
Sunbathing on rocky shores
</p>
<p>
Watching the silver fish swim by and
</p>
<p>
Examining the rocks at the bottom of the whirlpool
</p>
<p>
She’s
</p>
<p>
The person you think of
</p>
<p>
When you see the sun-stained polaroids on your wall
</p>
<p>
When you see the silver riverstones collected on your windowsill
</p>
<p>
When you see the pages and pages
</p>
<p>
And pages and pages you wrote
</p>
<p>
In your journal
</p>
<p>
She’s
</p>
<p>
The person you learn from
</p>
<p>
Jumping in barefoot and driving too fast
</p>
<p>
Painting your nails in the colors of the solar system and staring starry-eyed
</p>
<p>
At things you’ve seen before
</p>
<p>
And recording every moment
</p>
<p>
And afterwards,
</p>
<p>
You ask,
</p>
<p>
“When will we go again?”
</p>
