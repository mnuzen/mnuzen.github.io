<h1>An Immigrant’s Tale</h1>


<p>
Once upon a time, they are just stories. Once upon a time, she listens to them with awe: tales of magical beasts, ancient kingdoms, and endless seas with hungry, filching hands awaiting escapees and adventurers alike. Through these stories, she learns of humid rain and the smell of earth before a storm; she tastes sweet lychee and raw coconut; she learns to build boats with her bare hands. And—from her concrete jungle of a city—she dreams of the old country, her thoughts stained with syrupy condensed milk and blistering tropical sun.
</p>
<p>
Every night, right before she sleeps, her parents tell her these stories. They start with: <em>once upon a time, </em>and <em>long, long ago, </em>and <em>in the old country. </em>They sound like:
</p>
<p>
Once upon a time, there was a princess who lived in a castle, a girl who had everything she could ever want in her home: rich draperies and gold rings and the scarlet feather of a phoenix. She lived a happy and comfortable live. Long, long ago, there was a young man by the ocean, who woke up early every morning to watch the sun blink sleepily, to sail out on the sea and surround himself with endless, endless water, waiting for the right day to sail across to what waited on the other side. In the old country, there was a slumbering dragon, its belly full of fire hotter and fiercer than the sun and its wrath larger and older than the earth and its greed deeper and colder than the icy ocean.
</p>
<p>
Here, her parents tell her, here was a land loyal to the earth, the wind, the slow storms. Here, when summer comes, the plants unfurl their leathery fronds, and the earth begins to move slowly, like a great beast stirring into consciousness. The dirt and soil drinks in the clean rain and the soft smell of petrichor releases from a yawning maw as the beast awakens. Storms crackle over the horizon and the dragon flexes its poisonous claws, unfurls its leathery wings. Here is the edge of the land, here is the line between sea and skyline, they say, and here is how you cross it.
</p>
<p>
She asks for stories every day, reaches out with sweaty palms to ask for more, as if these stories are real, as if they are reminders placed into the palm of your hand, remnants of a past life that fit in the hollow of your cheek so you can bring them on a small boat across the sea.
</p>
<p>
In school, her chubby fingers grab fat red crayons to carve mountains and fire and dragons out of printer paper.
</p>
<p>
Her mother tells her of the food there: tin Tiffin boxes and enormous bowls of rich pork broth, carrying-poles with enormous woven baskets on either side, banyan trees peering down on curdling goat’s milk. Her mother tells her of all kinds of herbs, different herbs for different dishes: mint and basil and coriander and chives. Her mother tells her of all kinds of fruits: soft ripe mango, sweet and yellow; fleshy dragonfruit; refreshing lychee and slices of guava dipped in salt.
</p>
<p>
Her father tells her of a revolution: an endless fleet of boats—like fish swimming desperately up a stream—fleeing a harbor, out of the maw of the beast and into the hungry, filching hands of the sea. He tells her no one ever wants to leave their home, that you only climb into a boat when the sea is safer than the land. He tells her that every day was a wait, until finally the weather was right and the sea was calm and the land waiting for them on the other side was ready.
</p>
<p>
Outside of her open window, the city calls, a screeching cacophony of urban traffic and the rush of life, a constant reminder of where she lives, of where she will have to go. She wonders where she belongs. She wonders where she has to go. On her desk, her notebook paper rustles with the wind. She picks up her pen.
</p>
<p>
Once upon a time, she believed they were just stories.
</p>
<p>
She grows older and realizes that they are not just stories.
</p>
<p>
Once upon a time, she’d never seen anything with a knife for a tongue or creatures with poison-tipped claws; maybe she believed those stories were fantasy because it wasn’t possible to understand, it was so difficult to comprehend. How can you understand a wildfire when you’ve only ever used small matchsticks to keep warm? How can you understand what it takes to leave your home behind when home is where you’ve lived your whole life?
</p>
<p>
And how could she know? She will never feel the insistent flames of a revolution or that horrible, dark fear of no land past the sea, of no wind filling the sails; will never come face to face with beasts as ancient as dragons.
</p>
<p>
But instead, perhaps, she will face mountains of steel and birds of metal instead, swap out dark jungles for concrete cities.
</p>
<p>
Either way, she has her stories.
</p>
<p>
And in the end, they are still stories. Except they’re slightly starchy with grains of truth, a little gritty on the tongue, slightly bitter with a worldliness and a deep kind of hunger too powerful to be made up; but, after all, aren’t the best stories the ones of our own lives?
</p>
<p>
Once upon a time, there was a girl who lived in a world half-fantasy and half-reality, living the best kind of lucid dream, between the sky and the shoreline, between the past and the future, between kingdoms and democracy.
</p>
<p>
She is insatiable; she is young and she wants the world. She wants blistered skin from the tropical sun and treasures from the bottom of the greedy ocean and a fang from the yawning maw of the beast: a world all fantasy and all reality. She lives with <em>once upon a time</em> and <em>long long ago </em>and<em> in the old country</em> tucked into the space between her molars and her cheek, small enough to fit in the hollow of her cheek, to bring with her wherever she goes. When she smiles, the edges of her lips twist with the sweetness of condensed milk and raw sunshine, with the fire of a dragon’s breath. And, with that, she lives happily ever after.
</p>
<p>
The End.
</p>
